# Aegis Protocol - Project Status

## Current Status: Framework Development Phase

**Aegis Protocol is currently a DeFi automation framework, not a fully functional DeFi AI agent.**

### What We Have Built

✅ **Core Infrastructure**
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and client
- WASM module execution system
- Multi-agent coordination framework
- Wallet management system
- IPFS integration for module distribution

✅ **DeFi Framework Components**
- Strategy engine infrastructure
- Contract interaction framework
- Market data integration framework
- Risk management framework

### What's Missing (Implementation Gaps)

❌ **Real DeFi Protocol Integrations**
- Actual smart contract interactions with Uniswap, Aave, etc.
- Live blockchain connections
- Real transaction execution

❌ **Live Market Data**
- Pyth Network integration (currently simulated)
- Real-time price feeds
- Live arbitrage detection

❌ **Production-Ready Features**
- Multi-chain execution
- Enterprise security features
- Regulatory compliance systems

### Framework vs. Agent: Key Differences

| Aspect | Framework (Current) | Full Agent (Goal) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **DeFi Interactions** | Infrastructure for building integrations | Direct protocol interactions |
| **Market Data** | Framework for data feeds | Live price feeds and analytics |
| **Strategy Execution** | Strategy definition framework | Automated trading execution |
| **Risk Management** | Risk assessment framework | Real-time risk monitoring |

### Development Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Framework (Current)
- ✅ MCP protocol implementation
- ✅ WASM module system
- ✅ Multi-agent coordination framework
- ✅ Basic DeFi strategy definitions

#### Phase 2: Protocol Integration
- 🔄 Real smart contract interactions
- 🔄 Live blockchain connections
- 🔄 Pyth Network integration
- 🔄 Multi-chain support

#### Phase 3: Production Features
- 🔄 Enterprise security
- 🔄 Regulatory compliance
- 🔄 Institutional features
- 🔄 Advanced risk management

### Demo Limitations

Current demos show:
- ✅ Framework capabilities
- ✅ MCP protocol functionality
- ✅ WASM module execution
- ✅ Strategy definition

But do NOT show:
- ❌ Real DeFi transactions
- ❌ Live market data
- ❌ Actual profit generation
- ❌ Production security

### Getting Started for Developers

This framework is ideal for:
- Building custom DeFi automation tools
- Research and experimentation
- Educational purposes
- Prototyping DeFi strategies

For production DeFi automation, additional development is required to implement real protocol integrations and live data feeds.
