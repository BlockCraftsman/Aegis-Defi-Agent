# Aegis Protocol: DeFi AI Agent for the AI Agent Economy

## The AI Agent Economy is Here

**Aegis Protocol** represents a new paradigm in decentralized finance - autonomous AI Agents that participate in the emerging AI Agent Economy. We are not just building tools; we are creating economic actors that can autonomously generate value in DeFi markets.

## Vision

We envision a future where AI Agents become active participants in the global economy, with Aegis serving as the premier DeFi AI Agent that autonomously manages capital, executes strategies, and generates sustainable returns in the decentralized financial ecosystem.

## Mission

Our mission is to pioneer the DeFi AI Agent category - creating intelligent economic entities that can operate independently, coordinate with other agents, and contribute to a vibrant AI Agent Economy while maintaining security, transparency, and profitability.

## The DeFi AI Agent: A New Economic Actor

### What is a DeFi AI Agent?

Aegis is not merely an automation tool; it is an autonomous economic entity that:
