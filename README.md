# Aegis-Defi-Agent: AI-Powered DeFi Agent Platform

**Aegis-Defi-Agent** is an AI-powered DeFi automation framework that provides the infrastructure for building intelligent DeFi agents and strategies. 

## Why "Aegis-Defi-Agent"?

The name **Aegis-Defi-Agent** is deeply symbolic:

- **Aegis**: In Greek mythology, the Aegis was the divine shield of Zeus and Athena, representing **protection** and **defense**
- **Protocol**: Emphasizes our foundation as a **decentralized protocol** rather than a centralized service

This name perfectly captures our mission: to serve as an **AI-powered protective shield** for DeFi operations, safeguarding users from risks while enabling intelligent automation.

Built on four foundational technologies:

- **AI Agents**: Intelligent automation for DeFi operations
- **DeFi Integration**: Real-time market data and protocol interactions
- **Blockchain Security**: Trustless execution and coordination
- **MCP Protocol**: Standardized AI tool communication

As a DeFi automation framework, Aegis-Defi-Agent provides:
- Infrastructure for building DeFi agents and strategies
- Multi-agent coordination capabilities
- Real-time market data integration
- Trustless automation framework

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aegis-protocol/aegis-core.git
cd aegis-core
```

### 2. Configure Your Wallet
The Aegis-Defi-Agent requires a Web3 wallet to operate. The wallet's private key is encrypted in a `wallet.json` file, which is protected by a password.

**Set the Wallet Password**

You must provide this password to the server via the `WALLET_PASSWORD` environment variable.

You can set it directly in your terminal:
```bash
export WALLET_PASSWORD="your-strong-password-here"
```

Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in the `cmd/aegis-mcp-server/` directory. This file is ignored by Git, so your password will not be committed.

**Example `cmd/aegis-mcp-server/.env` file:**
```
# This password encrypts your wallet.json file.
# Keep this password and your wallet file secure.
WALLET_PASSWORD="your-strong-password-here"
```
When the server starts for the first time, it will automatically generate a `config/wallet.json` file for you using this password. **Do not commit `config/wallet.json` to version control.**

### 3. Build the Project

The project provides several Makefile targets for building and development:

#### Basic Builds
```bash
# Build both client and server
make all

# Build just the client
make build-client

# Build just the server 
make build-server
```

#### Cross-Compilation
```bash
# Build for all platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS, ARM)
make build-all

# Platform-specific builds
make build-linux    # Linux amd64
make build-windows  # Windows amd64 (.exe)
make build-darwin   # macOS amd64  
make build-arm      # Linux ARM64
```

#### Development
```bash
# Run client directly (no build)
make run-client

# Run server directly (no build)
make run-server

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

Build flags include version information:
- `BuildVersion`: Short git commit hash
- `BuildDate`: UTC timestamp of build
